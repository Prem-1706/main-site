        <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
        <p>Climate change refers to the long-term shifts in temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions on Earth. While natural factors play a role, human activities—particularly the burning of fossil fuels—are accelerating these changes. This results in a variety of harmful environmental effects.</p>

            <h3>Greenhouse Gases</h3>
            <p>The buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as CO₂, methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O), is causing the planet to warm. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, preventing it from escaping into space.</p>

            <h3>Rising Temperatures</h3>
            <p>Global temperatures are rising, leading to heatwaves, droughts, and changing weather patterns. This impacts food production, water resources, and the health of ecosystems.</p>

            <h3>Environmental Challenges</h3>
            <p>Rising sea levels due to melting glaciers, habitat destruction, and extreme weather events are just a few of the many challenges posed by climate change. These affect wildlife, coastal communities, and our natural resources.</p>

        <h2>How Can You Contribute?</h2>
        <p>There are several actions you can take to reduce your carbon footprint and help combat climate change. Every effort counts!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use energy-efficient appliances and switch to LED bulbs to reduce electricity consumption.</li>
            <li>Choose renewable energy sources like solar or wind power if possible.</li>
            <li>Drive less. Use public transport, walk, or bike to reduce your carbon emissions.</li>
            <li>Eat more plant-based foods. The livestock industry contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
            <li>Plant trees and support reforestation efforts to help absorb CO₂.</li>
        </ul>
